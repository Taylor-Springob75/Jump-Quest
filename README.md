# Jump-Quest
A 2D platformer that is my first attempt at a game

Jump Quest is a small, basic platformer that I am developing in my free time to try and keep up my skills.
My final goal for this project is a 5 level platformer with 4 "normal" levels, and then 1 "boss" level.

All assets in this project will be free use assets in case I ever decide I want to add more to the project, or officially publish one day.  
These include: Backgrounds, sprites, music, etc.  
Title screen background from: https://pressstart.vip/assets  
Title screen music from: https://peritune.com/ on their free BGM list (Memories6).  
Character sprite from: https://rvros.itch.io/ (Pixel Adventurer).  
Tiles from: https://o-lobster.itch.io/  (Pixel Art Metroidvania Asset Pack).  
Test page background from: https://vnitti.itch.io/ (Glacial Mountains: Parallax Background).
