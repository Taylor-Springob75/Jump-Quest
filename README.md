# Jump-Quest
A 2D platformer that is my first attempt at a game

Jump Quest is a small, basic platformer that I am developing in my free time to try and keep up my skills.
My final goal for this project is a 5 level platformer with 4 "normal" levels, and then 1 "boss" level.

All assets in this project will be free use assets in case I ever decide I want to add more to the project, or officially publish one day.  
These include: Backgrounds, Sprites, music, etc.
